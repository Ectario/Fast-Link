# Fast-Link

This software is very basic, it allows you to save links and be able to access them with just one click.

I created it because covid-19 required distance learning, which involved the use of online meeting. Fast link therefore makes it possible to save each of the links of these meetings, to give it a label and to be able to access it in 1 click.

Your saves of links are in the file named "dataFastLink" (need to be in the same directory than FastLink.py) so be cautious with it.

Advice : rename FastLink.py with extension .pyw like FastLink.pyw if you want hide the terminal.

(If you have Linux distribution with apt, then you need to go in the console and write : apt-get install python3-tk.)


Enjoy !
