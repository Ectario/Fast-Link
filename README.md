# Fast-Link

## Description

This software is very basic, it allows you to save links and be able to access them with just one click.

I created it because covid-19 required distance learning, which involved the use of online meeting. Fast link therefore makes it possible to save each of the links of these meetings, to give it a label and to be able to access it in 1 click.

## Installation

You need Python 3 : https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you have a linux distro with apt then you need to go to the console and write: `apt-get install python3-tk`. (To install the TKinter module, it is the native python module for the graphical interface, it is not native under linux)

## Usage

- Add

Click on the first edit text and fill it with the name of the link you want to put. Then copy and paste the link into the 2nd edit text. Then click on "Ajouter".

- Delete

Fill in the last edit text with the name of the link to remove (the link name and not the link address). Then click on "Supprimer".

- Saves

The data is automatically saved. 
Your saves of links are in the file named "dataFastLink" which need to be in the same directory than FastLink.py, so be cautious with it.

- Advice : rename FastLink.py with extension .pyw like FastLink.pyw if you want hide the terminal.
