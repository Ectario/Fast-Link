# Fast-Link

This software is very basic, it allows you to save links and be able to access them with just one click.

I created it because covid-19 required distance learning, which involved the use of online meeting. Fast link therefore makes it possible to save each of the links of these meetings, to give it a label and to be able to access it in 1 click.

You're saves of links are in the file named "dataFastLink" so be cautious with it.

Enjoy !
